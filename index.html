            <div class="col-sm">The purpose of this experiment is to study optical properties of various sources, such
                as
                computer displays and light emitting plugins. The study is for an upper-level undergraduate physics
                course on optics.
                This research is based on the first module of the course. It is designed to familizarize us with the
                tools necessary for measuring and describing optical properties.
                The culmination of this research is based on two parts. Part one is the study of a computer display.
                Using a Topcon SR-3 Photoradiometer, we characterized a display based on professional settings.
                Settings include, spectral radiance, luminance, color temperature, contrast ratio, and color quality
                based on the 1931 and 1976 CIE Systems.
                By analyzing these settings, we were able to understand performance standards for a LCD computer
                display.
                <br>
                Part two of the research measures optical properties of different light sources. We studied three types
                of light sources: a calibrated light source, a 10W incandescent light bulb, and a green light emitting
                diode (LED).
                We measured similar optical properties as the first part of the module. The purpose was to use the
                tools of the previous part to observe the radiance and luminance of different light sources through
                opal glass.

            Abstract
        </h2>
        <p class="abstract-text">
            In this experiment we measured the optical properties of an LCD Display, incandescent light bulb, and a
            LED. For the LCD, white and black measurements matched industry standards with white having a luminance of
            173 nits at a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 7600K.
            The contrast ratio between white and black came out to be 414:1 which is higher than the industry standard
            of 300:1.
            Color coordinates were accurate and matched the regions of the 1931 CIE coordinate system.
            The value of our gamma curve was found to be 2.07 which is lower than the industry standard. For the light
            bulb, we found the luminous flux to be 170 lm with an efficacy of 171 lm/W at a maximum voltage of 12V.
            CCT was first found to be 1579K at 3V, while at 12V it was 2549K.
            For the LED, luminous flux was measured to be 0.0569 lm with a CCT of 7236K when placed 30 cm away from an
            integrating sphere that had a variable diaphragm set at a max radius of 25 mm.

        <h2 class="body">Module One - Part One</h2>
        <p class="body-one">We began our experiment with part one, the characterization of an LCD display.
            Before taking any measurements, it was important to make sure our display's surface vector was normal to
            the photradiometer.
            To do this, we placed a laser above the Topcon instrument, overlayed the LCD display with a mirror, then
            adjusted the height of the photoradiometer and laser with respect to its reflection from the mirror.
            We did this until the laser light reflected back upon itself as shown below:

            </div>
            <br>
            Once the Topcon's sight was aligned with the normal vector, we powered on the device and looked through its
            lens.
            The lens had a distinct black dot at its center indicating the Topcon's field of view, the angle was set to
            1ยบ.
            Optical properties of the LCD screen were then measured at different pure colors of the rgb spectrum.

            recorded data of the screen's gray scale properties, stepping rgb values by 16.

                    255, 255), outputing white light. The rgb scale was then decremented from 255 to 0. With each
                    change of the display, spectral radiance was recorded. White and black light from the display was
                    measured twice. This was done to mitigate any possible errors. By collecting the same points twice,
                    we can compare the results for any discrepencies.</div>

        <p class="body-two">In the second part of the experiment, we measured similar optical properties of different
            light sources.
            Those sources include a calibrated light source, a 10W incandescent light bulb, and a green LED. In order
            to control the conical direction of light from the sources, each light emitting source was mounted inside
            an integrating sphere. A small spherical shell used to contain and direct light sources through opal glass.
            The following images show the 10W light bulb before and after installation into the sphere:

        </div>
        <p>
            Before turning on the 10W light bulb, baseline data was recorded with the calibrated light source through
            the opal glass. This establishes a standard set of values across the visible light spectrum from 380nm to
            780nm. We are able to compare data of other light sources to the calibrated results.

            <div class="col-sm">The purpose of this experiment is study optical properties of various sources, such as
                computer displays and light emitting plugins. The study is for an upper-level undergraduate physics
                course on optics.
                This research is based on the first module of the course. It is designed to familizarize us with the
                tools necessary for measuring and describing optical properties.
                The culmination of this research is based on two parts. Part one is the study of a computer display.
                Using a Topcon SR-3 Photoradiometer, we characterized a display based on professional settings.
                Settings include, spectral radiance, luminance, color temperature, contrast ratio, and color quality
                based on the 1931 and 1976 CIE Systems.
                By analyzing these settings, we were able to understand performance standards for a LCD computer
                display.
                <br>
                Part two of the research measures optical properties of different light sources. We studied three types
                of light sources: a calibrated light source, a 10W incandescent light bulb, and a green light emitting
                diode (LED).
                We measured similar optical properties as the first part of the module. The purpose was to use the
                tools of the previous part to observe the radiance and luminance of different light sources through an
                opal glass.

            Abstract
        </h2>
        <p class="abstract-text">
            In this experiment we measured the optical properties of an LCD Display, incandescent light bulb, and a
            LED. For the LCD, white and black measurements matched industry standards with white having a luminance of
            173 nits at a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 7600K.
            The contrast ratio between white and black came out to be 414:1 which is higher than the industry standard
            of 300:1.
            Color coordinates were accurate and matched the regions of the 1931 CIE coordinate system.
            The value of our gamma curve was found to be 2.07 which is lower than the industry standard. For the light
            bulb, we found the luminous flux to be 170 lm with an efficacy of 171 lm/W at a maximum voltage of 12V.
            CCT was first found to be 1579K at 3V, while at 12V it was 2549K.
            For the LED, luminous flux was measured to be 0.0569 lm with a CCT of 7236K when placed 30 cm away from an
            integrating sphere that had a variable diaphragm set at a max radius of 25 mm.
